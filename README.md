- MySQL 8.0.15
- D2RQ 0.8.1
- Java 1.8



This is a hands-on work about query a non-RDF database using SPARQL based on D2RQ. In this work, I create a relational database in MySQL and use SQL to SELECT some data. Then I run D2R server from the command line to execute the D2RQ mapping. We could access querying in HTML browsers or command line. The results are clearly showed in the page.



You can see the detailed document in **"Hands-on with D2RQ.pdf"** including installation and running.
